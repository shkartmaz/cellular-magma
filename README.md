Working my way towards multiple crystal phases & temperature-dependant crystallization

Cell class is used to store temperature and composition values
Magma temperature is converted to RGB using polynomial equations, which are pre-calculated using `Color_Match` [module](https://github.com/carpdiem/Color-Match) by carpdiem.  
Supported temperature range is from 500 to 2000 Celsius
